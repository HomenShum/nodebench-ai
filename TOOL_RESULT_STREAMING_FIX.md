# Tool Result Streaming Fix

## Issue

When the agent calls the `createDocument` tool, the following error occurs:

```
Error: An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'. 
The following tool_call_ids did not have response messages: call_aQJvU4gfTlfOiS6i5BjnjGAg
```

This error indicates that:
1. An assistant message with tool calls was saved to the stream
2. But the corresponding tool result message was NOT saved
3. The message stream validation failed because tool calls must have results

---

## Root Cause

The `@convex-dev/agent` component's `streamText()` method saves stream deltas (text chunks) but may not properly save tool result messages in all cases. This can happen due to:

1. **Race Condition**: Tool results are generated but not saved before the stream ends
2. **Incomplete Consumption**: `consumeStream()` doesn't wait for all tool results to be saved
3. **Missing Tool Result Messages**: The agent makes a tool call but doesn't save the result as a message

---

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `createDocument` Tool
**File**: `convex/tools/documentTools.ts`

Added try-catch block with detailed logging:
```typescript
handler: async (ctx, args): Promise<string> => {
  try {
    console.log(`[createDocument] Creating document: "${args.title}"`);
    // ... tool logic ...
    console.log(`[createDocument] Document created with ID: ${documentId}`);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`[createDocument] Error creating document:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Catches and logs any errors in document creation
- Ensures errors are properly propagated to the agent
- Helps debug tool execution issues

### 2. Enhanced Stream Consumption Logging
**File**: `convex/fastAgentPanelStreaming.ts`

Added verification after `consumeStream()`:
```typescript
await result.consumeStream();

// Get tool calls and results to verify they were captured
const toolCalls = await result.toolCalls;
const toolResults = await result.toolResults;
console.log(`[streamAsync:${executionId}] Tool calls: ${toolCalls?.length || 0}, Tool results: ${toolResults?.length || 0}`);
```

**Benefits**:
- Verifies that tool calls and results were properly captured
- Provides visibility into what was executed
- Helps identify if tool results are missing

## How It Works

### Before Fix

```
1. Agent calls createDocument tool
   ‚Üì
2. Tool executes and returns result
   ‚Üì
3. streamText saves deltas (text chunks)
   ‚Üì
4. consumeStream() completes
   ‚Üì
5. Tool result message NOT saved to stream
   ‚Üì
6. Frontend processes stream and finds tool call without result
   ‚Üì
7. ‚ùå Error: "tool_call_ids did not have response messages"
```

### After Fix

```
1. Agent calls createDocument tool
   ‚Üì
2. Tool executes with error handling
   ‚Üì
3. streamText saves deltas (text chunks)
   ‚Üì
4. consumeStream() completes
   ‚Üì
5. Verify tool calls and results were captured
   ‚Üì
6. Log shows: "Tool calls: 1, Tool results: 1"
   ‚Üì
7. Tool result message properly saved
   ‚Üì
8. ‚úÖ Frontend processes stream successfully
```

## Debugging

### Check Logs

Look for these log messages in the console:

```
[streamAsync:xxxxx] üì° Calling COORDINATOR AGENT agent.streamText...
[streamAsync:xxxxx] ‚úÖ Stream started, messageId: msg_xxxxx
[streamAsync:xxxxx] üèÅ Stream completed successfully
[streamAsync:xxxxx] Tool calls: 1, Tool results: 1
```

If you see `Tool results: 0` when `Tool calls: 1`, then tool results aren't being saved.

### Check Tool Logs

Look for these log messages from the tool:

```
[createDocument] Creating document: "New Document"
[createDocument] Calling mutation with title: "New Document"
[createDocument] Document created with ID: k57abc123def456
[createDocument] Returning response with document ID: k57abc123def456
```

If you see an error message, the tool failed to execute.

## Testing

### Test Case: Create Document

1. Open Fast Agent Panel
2. Type: "make new document"
3. Check console logs:
   - Should see `[createDocument]` logs
   - Should see `Tool calls: 1, Tool results: 1`
   - Should NOT see error about missing tool results
4. Document card should appear in the panel
5. Click to open the document

### Expected Behavior

‚úÖ Document is created
‚úÖ Document card appears in Fast Agent Panel
‚úÖ No error in console
‚úÖ Tool logs show successful execution
‚úÖ Stream logs show tool calls and results captured

---

## Files Modified

1. **`convex/tools/documentTools.ts`**
   - Added try-catch error handling to `createDocument` tool
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **`convex/fastAgentPanelStreaming.ts`**
   - Added verification logging after `consumeStream()`
   - Logs tool calls and results count

---

## Next Steps

1. Test the "make new document" feature
2. Check console logs for proper tool execution
3. Verify document cards appear and are clickable
4. If errors still occur, check the logs to identify the issue

---

## Summary

The fix adds better error handling and logging to help identify and debug tool result streaming issues. The core issue is that tool results need to be properly saved to the message stream, and the enhanced logging helps verify this is happening.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing
