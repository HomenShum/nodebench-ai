## Architecture

### **6-Phase Multi-Agent Pipeline**

```
Phase 1: PARALLEL RESEARCH (5 agents)
├── weather_research        → Search weather forecast
├── attractions_research    → Search top attractions
├── restaurants_research    → Search best restaurants
├── hotels_research         → Search hotels
└── transportation_research → Search public transit

Phase 2: PREFERENCE LEARNING (1 agent)
└── learn_preferences       → Analyze user preferences

Phase 3: DATA PROCESSING (4 agents - Gemini Code Execution)
├── parse_weather          → Extract daily weather data
├── parse_attractions      → Filter & rank attractions
├── parse_restaurants      → Filter & rank restaurants
└── parse_hotels           → Filter & rank hotels

Phase 4: ITINERARY OPTIMIZATION (1 agent - Gemini Code Execution)
└── optimize_itinerary     → Create day-by-day schedule

Phase 5: BOOKING INTEGRATION (1 agent)
└── generate_booking_links → Generate booking URLs

Phase 6: FINAL SYNTHESIS (1 agent)
└── synthesize_plan        → Create detailed markdown plan
```

**Total**: 15 nodes, 20 edges, 6 phases

## Input Schema

```typescript
interface TripPlanningInput {
  destination: string;        // e.g., "San Francisco"
  startDate: string;          // YYYY-MM-DD
  endDate: string;            // YYYY-MM-DD
  budget?: 'budget' | 'moderate' | 'luxury';
  preferences?: {
    cuisine?: string[];       // e.g., ['Italian', 'Japanese']
    activities?: string[];    // e.g., ['museums', 'hiking']
    pace?: 'relaxed' | 'moderate' | 'packed';

## Example Usage

### **1. Create Task Spec**

```json
{
  "goal": "Plan a 2-day trip to San Francisco from October 3-4, 2025",
  "type": "orchestrate",
  "topic": "San Francisco trip October 3-4, 2025",
  "tripPlanning": {
    "destination": "San Francisco",
    "startDate": "2025-10-03",
    "endDate": "2025-10-04",
    "budget": "moderate",
    "preferences": {
      "cuisine": ["Italian", "Japanese", "Farm-to-table"],
      "activities": ["museums", "parks", "food tours", "scenic views"],
      "pace": "moderate",
      "dietary": ["vegetarian-friendly"],
      "accessibility": []
    },
    "travelers": 2
  }
}
```

### **2. Run via CLI**

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
export LINKUP_API_KEY="your-linkup-api-key"

# Run trip planning
npx tsx agents/app/cli.ts agents/app/demo_scenarios/task_spec_trip_sf.json
```

### **3. Programmatic Usage**

```typescript
import { orchestrate } from './agents/core/orchestrator';
import { buildTripPlanningGraph } from './agents/graphs/tripPlanning';

const input = {
  destination: "San Francisco",
  startDate: "2025-10-03",
  endDate: "2025-10-04",
  budget: "moderate",
  preferences: {
    cuisine: ["Italian", "Japanese"],
    activities: ["museums", "parks"],
    pace: "moderate"
  },
  travelers: 2
};

const graph = buildTripPlanningGraph(input);

const result = await orchestrate({
  taskSpec: {
    goal: "Plan SF trip",
    type: "orchestrate",
    topic: "San Francisco trip",
    graph
  },
  tools,
  trace,
  data
});

console.log(result.result); // Detailed markdown trip plan
```
