"$500K" → 500,000
"$1.5B" → 1,500,000,000
```

Detects industry from company data:
```
Keywords: healthcare, health, medical, biotech, pharma,
clinical, hospital, patient, disease, treatment, therapy,
drug, medicine, wellness, telemedicine, diagnostics, lab,
genetic, vaccine, life science
```

### 3. extractFoundingYear()
**File**: `convex/agents/criteriaSearch.ts:70-97`

Extracts founding year from text:
```
Patterns:
- "founded in 2022"
- "established 2023"
- "launched 2021"

Main filtering function - checks ALL criteria:
```typescript
function matchesCriteria(company, criteria) {
  // Check funding
  if (criteria.minFunding) {
    if (company.totalFunding < parseFundingAmount(criteria.minFunding)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  // Check industry
  if (criteria.industry) {
    if (!extractIndustry(...).includes(criteria.industry)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  // Check founding year
  if (criteria.minFoundingYear) {
    if (extractFoundingYear(...) < criteria.minFoundingYear) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  // Check founder experience
  if (criteria.requireFounderExperience) {
    if (!checkFounderExperience(...)) {

## ✅ Criteria Matching Logic

**AND Logic**: All criteria must be met

```
✅ Funding >= $2M
  AND
✅ Industry = healthcare
  AND
✅ Founded year >= 2022
  AND
✅ Founders have experience

= Company matches criteria
```

If ANY criterion fails → Company is rejected
