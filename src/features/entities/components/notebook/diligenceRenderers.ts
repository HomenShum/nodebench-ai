/**
 * diligenceRenderers — single-source registry of block-specific renderers.
 *
 * Pattern: generic renderer contract (PR9 from the notebook refactor).
 *          The plugin shell stays block-agnostic; adding a new block type
 *          is a one-line change here plus a new renderer file under
 *          `renderers/`.
 *
 * Missing block types are handled by the plugin's built-in default
 * renderer, so shipping renderers incrementally is safe.
 *
 * See: src/features/entities/components/notebook/DiligenceDecorationPlugin.ts
 *      src/features/entities/components/notebook/renderers/*.tsx
 *      docs/architecture/DILIGENCE_BLOCKS.md
