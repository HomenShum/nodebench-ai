How can we make the simplest ai agent app possible that can produce following results in the daily prophet harry potter style and wall street newspaper style

show all sort of documents with sources.

Real Example research results and the sources touched :

Here’s a fast snapshot of *early-stage (seed & Series A)* funding that’s actually been reported in the last ~24 hours plus the immediately preceding few days in **healthcare, life sciences, and tech**. There isn’t (yet) a big centralized “today-only” health/life-sci funding dump, so for those sectors I’m pulling the freshest clearly-dated deals from this week and calling out what is *truly* dated Nov 16 vs earlier.

---

## 1️⃣ Healthcare & life sciences – latest seed / Series A

> **No clearly new health or life-science seed/Series A rounds are date-stamped Nov 16 yet** in major outlets. The most recent early-stage deals (last 3–4 days) are:

### Digital health & healthtech

* **OutcomesAI (US – digital nursing / virtual care)** – **$10M seed**

  * **Stage:** Seed

  * **What they do:** FDA-cleared **AR-powered surgical navigation** that overlays 3D anatomy (“X-ray vision”) on the patient in real time to guide minimally invasive procedures.

### Biotech / therapeutics

  * **Stage:** Series A, announced **Nov 13** (still “fresh” in this week’s pipeline).
  * **What they do:** Precision RNA therapies; the round is explicitly framed as funding lead candidate development and expanding the RNA platform.
  * **Round:** **$29M Series A** plus appointment of new leadership to drive development into the clinic. ([PharmaDispatch][4])

---

## 2️⃣ Broader tech – seed & Series A **reported today**

These are **actually date-stamped Nov 16 (or within the last ~24h)** and fall into broader tech (AI, SaaS, future-of-work, etc.):

### Larger, thematically relevant AI / infra

* **Wonderful (Israel – AI agents)** – **$100M Series A at $700M valuation**

  * **Stage:** Series A
  * **What they do:** Autonomous AI agents for enterprise workflows (AI-agent platform).
  * **Round:** **$100M Series A**, valuing the company at **$700M post-money**, reflecting strong investor appetite for AI agent infrastructure. ([AI Daily][5])

* **Fintary (Europe – insurtech commissions platform)** – **$10M Series A**

  * **Stage:** Series A
  * **What they do:** Automates **insurance commission management** for brokers and agencies (B2B SaaS / fintech).
  * **Round:** **$10M Series A** to scale its platform and expand into more markets; press release is dated **Nov 16, 2025**. ([Detroit Free Press][6])

* **Uare.ai (Individual-AI platform)** – **$10.3M seed**

  * **Stage:** Seed
  * **What they do:** Positions itself as “Individual AI” (personalized AI layer); building a new category where users get persistent, personalized AI agents.
  * **Round:** Article notes **$10.3M in seed funding**, with coverage tagged to **Nov 16, 2025**. ([Futurism Today][7])

### Smaller but notable early-stage tech rounds

* **Nyayanidhi (India – legaltech)** – **$2M seed**

  * **Stage:** Seed
  * **What they do:** Legal-tech platform streamlining litigation and case-management workflows (Indian legal system focus).
  * **Round:** **$2M seed** led by 3one4 Capital with participation from other investors; reported ~22 hours ago. ([StartupNews.fyi][8])

* **ExtraMile Play (India – HR / gamified engagement)** – **$500K seed**

  * **Stage:** Seed
  * **What they do:** **Gamified employee engagement** platform to boost retention and motivation.
  * **Round:** **$500K seed** led by GSF with participation from angels, reported as a fresh seed round today. ([Bharat Fast][9])

* **Nia.one (India – worker benefits for gig economy)** – **$2.4M seed**

  * **Stage:** Seed
  * **What they do:** Platform to improve the lives of gig and migrant workers (financial protection, benefits, support services).
  * **Round:** **$2.4M seed** (≈₹21.3 crore) from a mix of investors, explicitly framed as strengthening the support ecosystem for India’s gig workforce. ([Bharat Fast][10])

---

## 3️⃣ Quick pattern notes (today’s early-stage tape)

* **Health / life-sci news lags by a few days:** Early-stage healthcare and biotech financings (OutcomesAI, Praan Health, RAGE Biotech, MediView XR) are hitting the wires with datelines from **Nov 12–13** or earlier, even though they’re still being recirculated. There aren’t yet obvious *brand-new* health/biotech seed/Series A rounds dated Nov 16 in major outlets. ([DH Arab][1])
* **AI is dominating today’s headlines:** Wonderful’s **$100M Series A for AI agents** and Uare.ai’s **$10.3M seed** illustrate how much capital is flowing into AI infra and “agent” layers, even at early stages. ([AI Daily][5])
* **Workforce + workflow themes:** Across sectors (nursing, gig workers, employee engagement, insurance distribution, legal process), you see a clear through-line of **automating or augmenting human workflows rather than replacing them outright**.

---

If you’d like, next step I can:

* Re-slice this as a **VC-style daily memo** (e.g., “Deals to know today by theme” with one-liners you can paste into a CRM), or
* Filter it just to **healthcare / life-sci** and build a watch-list of companies to track from seed → A.

Thinking
Summarizing today's healthcare, life sciences, and tech funding
Refining search for focused startup funding news
The search results are a bit too broad, bringing in stuff that isn’t specifically about today’s (Nov 16, 2025) seed and Series A funding in healthcare, life sciences, and tech. I think I need to refine things a bit more — maybe use more targeted sites like Crunchbase News or MedCity News. Time for a more focused query!

Refining search for November 16, 2025 startup funding
Refining search strategy for funding stories
The search isn’t turning up many funding-specific stories today. I think I could focus more on specialized platforms, like Seedtable, but it’s more regional and doesn’t filter by sector. Maybe Crunchbase News or TechCrunch's funding sections will give me better results — I’ll try refining my query with new, targeted dates.

Searching for recent funding rounds by sector and date
Navigating today's funding search and sector focus
It’s tricky to find a single global daily funding report for today. Many reports are weekly, and time zones complicate things. I found a few funding announcements, like Wonderful's Series A for an AI customer service agent. However, the user specifically wants healthcare, life sciences, and tech funding — I'll keep looking closer.

Clarifying funding dates for search results
The TechBuzz article is a bit older (Oct 16), and the "Nov 16" timestamp is likely just from when it was scraped, not the actual funding date. There’s a Series A for Fintary in fintech, dated Nov 16—this counts as tech. Still, I haven’t found healthcare deals for today — I’ll check BioVoice.

Searching for today's Seed and Series A funding deals
Limiting scope to targeted health funding news
The BioVoice page features good health sector funding, but the dates aren’t clear. While it provides insight, it’s hard to find "today's" deals due to the coverage limits. There’s no global daily list, so I’ll focus on major outlets' reported funding within the past 24 hours and be transparent about coverage gaps.

Searching health funding news for November 2025
Adjusting strategy for a snapshot of funding deals
This feels like too much noise. I think shifting the strategy might help: instead of aiming to find every single deal for today, I’ll aim for a "best-effort" snapshot. I can focus on highlighting a few key early-stage deals from the past 24 hours in the requested sectors.

Locating relevant funding stories for today
I need to focus on funding deals specifically from November 16, 2025. I'll look for healthcare, life sciences, and general tech (like AI SaaS). I've found a couple of deals so far, like Wonderful's $100M Series A and Fintary's $10M Series A. But I still need healthcare/life sciences deals. Time to search again with refined terms.

Searching for healthcare and biotech funding deals
Scaling down scope and being transparent
I need to narrow the focus and be transparent with the user. I'll use a curated funding roundup tool that lists recent rounds, focusing on the past 24 hours. Not all deals may be from today, but I’ll be clear that funding stories often come with some lag. Transparency is key.

Identifying recent healthcare funding deals
I’ve found some relevant healthcare funding stories from the past few days. For healthcare/digital health:

OutcomesAI raised $10M in seed funding on November 12.

Praan Health secured Rs 8.5 crore ($1M) seed round on November 12.

MediView XR closed $24M Series A, announced November 15.

These deals are a bit beyond "today," but they’re all very recent.

Identifying life sciences and tech funding recent deals
For life sciences and medtech:

MediView XR raised $24M in Series A on Nov 15.

Rage Biotech raised $29M on Nov 13.

Both qualify despite not being today. Braveheart Bio’s $185M Series A (Nov 5) is older, so might not work.

For general tech:

Wonderful: $100M Series A on Nov 16.

Fintary: $10M Series A on Nov 16.

Searching for Series A funding rounds on November 16
Clarifying healthcare / life sciences funding for Nov 16
I couldn't find any healthcare or life sciences funding with a Nov 16 date. RAGE Biotech's article is labeled Nov 16, but the actual funding round was Nov 13. Sirnaomics and TRIMTECH have older news that's not relevant today. A narrow search might help, but it's unlikely we'll find something fresh from this specific date.

Presenting a concise snapshot of funding rounds
I’ll present a snapshot of the latest funding rounds in tech and healthcare. For health & life sciences, I’ll clarify that the latest confirmed funding comes from news covering rounds from November 12-15, such as the $24M Series A for MediView XR. I'll also search for additional details on that deal.

Searching for recent healthcare and biotech funding rounds
Presenting a pragmatic funding snapshot
I’ll focus on analysing a few notable seed/Series A deals from the last 24 hours across the specified sectors, like Uare.ai’s recent $10.3M seed funding on November 16, 2025. Though MediView’s Series A was in October, I’ll clearly note that for clarity, prioritizing recent deals from actual funding rounds.

Creating a focused snapshot of recent deals
I'll share a mix of notable seed/Series A raises across healthcare, life sciences, and tech. For healthcare/life sciences, I’ll mention deals like RAGE Biotech’s $29M and OutcomesAI’s $10M seed from earlier this week. I'll also include general tech deals like Uare.ai’s $10.3M and Nia.one’s $2.4M seed, acknowledging their relevance today.

Clarifying recent seed/Series A deals
To stay clear, I'll clarify: if the user means "today" literally, there aren't any new healthcare/life sciences seed/Series A deals from Nov 16. I'll then share deals from the past few days. I'll present this clearly in bullet form, with key items listed, and include a navlist of relevant news sources.

Gathering relevant funding deals
I'll compile recent funding deals from sources like Nia.one's seed round and the Healthcare IT Today weekly roundup. I'll also check articles like Reuters on Corintis, though it’s not early-stage, and business-standard’s startups page. I'll gather accurate details on each, including amount, stage, sector, and a brief description.

Summarizing Fintary and Wonderful funding rounds
Fintary secured $10M in Series A to automate insurance commission management, announced on November 16, 2025. For Wonderful, I'll need to confirm details, but it's an Israeli AI startup that raised $100M in Series A for AI customer-service agents, with a valuation of $700M. I'll look for more specifics and investor names.

Reviewing funding details and company information
Refining details for AI and health funding
The Uare.ai article is another mention of its $10.3M seed funding, this time from Futurism Today, but there's no new information; the snippet is enough. For health and life sciences, I'll use the RAGE Biotech article from BiopharmaDispatch, though the site lists it as November 16, while the date in the article is November 13. I'll check for more details.

Filtering and updating health/AI funding sources
Finalizing details on RAGE Biotech and OutcomesAI
For RAGE Biotech, we have the date (Nov 13) and the information that they raised $29M in Series A. For OutcomesAI, we'll revisit the summary we reviewed earlier, as it seems like it wasn’t fully processed yet. So, I'll keep those details in

Summarizing OutcomesAI investment and status
Checking details for Praan Health funding
For Praan Health, I need to open the article from TICE to confirm their sector and the exact funding amount. While I have some information, opening it will give me a clearer picture to complete the details accurately.

Analyzing Praan Health sector and amount details
Summarizing today's global early-stage funding snapshot
We have sufficient info: Praan Health's healthtech seed round (Rs 8.5cr, Nov 12) is confirmed. We also have RAGE Biotech for life sciences. I'll make sure to use news sources for citation and construct the summary carefully, sticking to the remaining available calls under the allowed limit.

Crafting a concise early-stage funding snapshot
I'll summarize today’s early-stage deals: a quick intro to the funding landscape is key, noting it’s incomplete.

Then: Section 1 focuses on healthcare & life sciences, with details on stage, amount, location, and focus.

I'll follow with Section 2 for general tech, followed by micro-takeaways like valuations and AI trends.

Finally, I'll include a list of sources and citations where necessary.

Summarizing healthcare & life sciences funding
In the last few days (November 12–14):

OutcomesAI (US) raised a $10M seed for AI-driven nursing care (Nov 12).

Praan Health (India) secured Rs 8.5 crore ($1M) for chronic-care management (Nov 12).

MediView XR (US) raised $24M Series A for AR navigation in surgery (Oct 6, recapped Nov 14).

RAGE Biotech (Australia) secured $29M Series A for RNA therapeutics (Nov 13).

I'll start with: “No health/life-sciences seed/Series A rounds reported today; the most recent are...”

Summarizing general tech funding (today)
Wonderful (Israel): $100M Series A for AI autonomous agents (Nov 16).

Fintary (Germany): $10M Series A for commission management (Nov 16).

Uare.ai (location uncertain, likely US): $10.3M seed for "Individual AI" (Nov 16).

Nyayanidhi (India): $2M seed for legal tech (Nov 15/16).

ExtraMile Play (India): $500K seed for gamified employee engagement SaaS.

Nia.one (India): $2.4M seed for gig worker benefits.

I'll mention stage and domain and include citations for each.
