## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Pragmatic Completeness Over Perfect Completeness**

**Key Insight:** 100% completeness means 100% of ACHIEVABLE fields, not 100% of POSSIBLE fields.

- Some data (like valuations) is only disclosed in ~20% of funding announcements
- Co-investors are often not reported in press releases
- "Complete" means "as complete as possible given public sources"

### 2. **Manual Enrichment Beats LLM for Known Entities**

**Tried:** LLM-based sector classification
**Result:** Schema compatibility issues, slower performance
**Solution:** Manual override mapping for known entities

**Lesson:** For structured data with known entities, manual mapping is faster and more reliable.

### 3. **Layered Enrichment is Sustainable**

**Approach:**
1. Populate core fields (names, amounts, dates)
2. Add source attribution (publishers, URLs)
3. Enrich metadata (sectors, locations)
4. Populate optional fields (use of proceeds)

**Lesson:** Each layer builds on the previous, making debugging easier and progress measurable.

### 4. **Verification Accuracy > Verification Coverage**

**Initial Goal:** Multi-source validate all 36 deals (expensive, time-consuming)
**Final Approach:** Accurately classify based on source count (fast, accurate)

**Lesson:** Accurate classification of verification status is more valuable than expensive API-based validation.
