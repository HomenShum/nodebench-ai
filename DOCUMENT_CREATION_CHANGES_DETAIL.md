# Document Creation Fix - Detailed Changes

## File: `convex/agents/specializedAgents.ts`

### Change 1: DocumentAgent Instructions (Lines 30-88)

#### Added Critical Rule for Document Creation

```typescript
// BEFORE: No explicit rule for document creation
// AFTER: Added explicit rule #3

3. When user asks to CREATE, MAKE, or NEW document:
   - IMMEDIATELY call createDocument with a clear title
   - If no specific title given, use a descriptive default like "New Document" or infer from context
   - Do NOT ask for clarification - just create it
```

#### Added Document Creation Examples

```typescript
DOCUMENT CREATION EXAMPLES:
- "Make new document" → createDocument with title "New Document"
- "Create a document" → createDocument with title "New Document"
- "Create a document about AI" → createDocument with title "AI Document"
- "Make a new investment thesis" → createDocument with title "Investment Thesis"
- "Create document for Q4 planning" → createDocument with title "Q4 Planning"
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Gives the agent explicit examples of document creation patterns
- Shows how to infer titles from context
- Demonstrates the "no clarification" approach
- Provides clear guidance on default titles

### Change 2: CoordinatorAgent Instructions (Lines 1106-1121)

#### Added Document Creation Examples to Delegation Rules

```typescript
// BEFORE: No document creation examples
// AFTER: Added 3 document creation examples

EXAMPLES - IMMEDIATE DELEGATION:
- "Find me documents and videos about Google" → ...
- "Get Apple's 10-K filing" → ...
- "Search for cat images" → ...
- "What's the latest news on AI?" → ...
- "Show me the revenue report" → ...
- "Find YouTube videos about Python programming" → ...
- "Find videos about Python" → ...
- "Find the revenue report" → ...
+ "Make new document" → IMMEDIATELY call delegateToDocumentAgent("Make new document")
+ "Create a document" → IMMEDIATELY call delegateToDocumentAgent("Create a document")
+ "Create a new document about X" → IMMEDIATELY call delegateToDocumentAgent("Create a new document about X")
- "Research Anthropic" → ...
- "Tell me about Sam Altman" → ...
- "Compare Anthropic and OpenAI" → ...
- "What's Anthropic's funding?" → ...
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Teaches CoordinatorAgent to recognize document creation requests
- Shows immediate delegation pattern (no questions)
- Provides pattern matching examples
- Ensures requests reach DocumentAgent quickly

## How the Fix Works

### Before the Fix

```
User: "make new document"
    ↓
CoordinatorAgent
    ├─ No explicit rule for document creation
    ├─ Might try to answer directly
    ├─ Might ask clarifying questions
    └─ Might not delegate to DocumentAgent
         ↓
    Result: ❌ Nothing happens
```

### After the Fix

```
User: "make new document"
    ↓
CoordinatorAgent
    ├─ Recognizes "make" + "document" keywords
    ├─ Matches against explicit examples
    ├─ IMMEDIATELY delegates to DocumentAgent
    └─ Passes exact query
         ↓
    DocumentAgent
         ├─ Recognizes "make" + "new" + "document"
         ├─ Matches against explicit examples
         ├─ IMMEDIATELY calls createDocument
         └─ Uses "New Document" as default title
              ↓
         createDocument Tool
              ├─ Creates document in database
              ├─ Returns document ID
              └─ Embeds HTML marker
                   ↓
         Fast Agent Panel
              ├─ Extracts document action
              ├─ Renders DocumentActionCard
              └─ User can click to open
                   ↓
         Result: ✅ Document created and displayed
```

## Keyword Recognition

### CoordinatorAgent Recognizes

- "make" + "document"
- "create" + "document"
- "new" + "document"
- Any combination of these keywords

### DocumentAgent Recognizes

- "make" + "new" + "document"
- "create" + "document"
- "new" + "document"
- "create" + "new" + "document"
- Any variation with these keywords

---

## Title Inference Logic

### Explicit Title Provided
```
Input: "Create a document about AI"
Logic: Extract topic from context
Result: Title = "AI Document"
```

### No Title Provided
```
Input: "Make new document"
Logic: Use default
Result: Title = "New Document"
```

### Specific Type Mentioned
```
Input: "Make a new investment thesis"
Logic: Extract type from context
Result: Title = "Investment Thesis"
```

- [ ] "make a new investment thesis" creates document with title "Investment Thesis"
- [ ] Document card appears in Fast Agent Panel
- [ ] Document card is clickable
- [ ] Clicking opens document in editor
- [ ] Document ID is displayed
- [ ] Multiple documents can be created in sequence
