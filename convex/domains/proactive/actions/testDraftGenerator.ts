Thanks for taking the time to meet with me yesterday. I really enjoyed our discussion about the potential partnership between our companies.

As we discussed, I think there's a great opportunity for collaboration on the Q2 product launch. I'd love to move forward with the next steps we outlined:

1. Draft proposal by end of week
2. Review with your team next Monday
3. Finalize terms by month end

Let me know if this timeline still works for you, or if you need any adjustments.

Looking forward to working together!

Best,
Michael Chen
