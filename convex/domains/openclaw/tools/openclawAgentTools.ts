/**
 * OpenClaw Agent Tools — Tools exposed to the coordinator agent
 *
 * These tools allow the coordinator agent to spawn, manage, and audit
 * OpenClaw sessions through the Convex backend. They wrap internal
 * mutations/queries for safe, typed access from the agent framework.
 *
 * NOTE: Every tool MUST have at least one required string field in its
 * parameters schema.  When all fields are optional the AI SDK may
 * serialize the JSON Schema as `type: "None"` which crashes model
 * providers (e.g. OpenAI "Invalid schema … got 'type: None'").
