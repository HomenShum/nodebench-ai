# ✅ FIXED - "Unknown Tool" Display in Agent Progress Timeline

## 🎯 Problem

The Agent Progress timeline section in the Fast Agent Panel was displaying "Unknown Tool" multiple times instead of showing actual tool names that were executed.

**What users saw:**
```html
<span class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">Unknown  Tool</span>
<div class="text-xs text-gray-600 mt-0.5">Tool: <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Unknown Tool</code></div>
```

**What they should have seen:**
- "Web Search"
- "Sec Company Search"
- "Delegate To Web Agent"
- etc.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Location:** `src/components/FastAgentPanel/StepTimeline.tsx` (line 222)

**The Bug:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This field doesn't exist in AI SDK v5
const toolName = (part as any).toolName || 'Unknown Tool';
```

**Why it failed:**
1. The code was trying to access `(part as any).toolName` which doesn't exist
2. In AI SDK v5, tool names are embedded in the `type` field, not a separate property
3. Tool part types follow the format: `tool-${toolName}`, `tool-result-${toolName}`, `tool-error-${toolName}`
4. Examples: `'tool-webSearch'`, `'tool-result-secCompanySearch'`, `'tool-error-delegateToWebAgent'`

---

## ✅ Solution

**Changed:** `src/components/FastAgentPanel/StepTimeline.tsx` (lines 215-278)

**Key improvements:**
1. Extract tool name from `part.type` field instead of non-existent `toolName` property
2. Handle all AI SDK v5 tool part type variants:
   - `tool-call` → extract from part properties
   - `tool-${toolName}` → direct tool name
   - `tool-result-${toolName}` → extract tool name after "result-"
   - `tool-error-${toolName}` → extract tool name after "error-"
3. Use `.startsWith()` for status detection instead of exact equality checks

**New code:**
```typescript
// Extract tool name from type field (e.g., 'tool-webSearch' -> 'webSearch')
let toolName = 'Unknown Tool';

if (part.type.startsWith('tool-')) {
  const remainder = part.type.slice(5);
  
  if (remainder.startsWith('result-')) {
    toolName = remainder.slice(7); // Remove 'result-'
  } else if (remainder.startsWith('error-')) {
    toolName = remainder.slice(6); // Remove 'error-'
  } else if (remainder === 'call') {
    toolName = (part as any).toolName || 'Unknown Tool';
  } else {
    toolName = remainder; // Direct tool name
  }
}
```

## 📊 Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ All tool execution steps: "Unknown Tool"
- ❌ No indication of what actions the agent performed
- ❌ Confusing user experience

**After:**
- ✅ Correct tool names: "webSearch", "secCompanySearch", "delegateToWebAgent", etc.
- ✅ Clear indication of agent actions
- ✅ Meaningful timeline that helps users understand agent behavior

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- ✅ **Committed:** `42e20ee`
- ✅ **Pushed:** main branch
- ✅ **Status:** Deployed and ready to test

---

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open the Fast Agent Panel
2. Execute an agent query that uses multiple tools
3. Check the "Agent Progress" timeline section
4. Verify that tool names are displayed correctly (e.g., "Web Search", "Sec Company Search")
5. Expand timeline steps to see tool arguments and results

## 📝 Technical Details

### AI SDK v5 Tool Part Format

The `ToolUIPart` type from the `ai` package uses typed naming:

```typescript
// Tool call (in progress)
type: 'tool-webSearch'

// Tool result (completed)
type: 'tool-result-webSearch'

// Tool error (failed)
type: 'tool-error-webSearch'
```

The tool name is embedded in the type string, not in a separate property. This is different from earlier versions of the AI SDK.

### Why This Matters

The timeline component needs to extract and display tool names to give users visibility into what the agent is doing. With this fix, users can now see:
- Which tools were called
- In what order
- Whether they succeeded or failed
- What arguments were passed
- What results were returned

This is critical for debugging agent behavior and understanding the agent's reasoning process.

## ✨ Key Lesson

**Always check the actual data structure of external libraries!**

When working with types from external packages like `@vercel/ai`, it's important to:
1. Check the actual type definitions
2. Log the data to see what fields are available
3. Read the migration guides when upgrading versions
4. Test with real data to verify assumptions

The AI SDK v5 migration guide explicitly mentions the change to typed tool naming, but it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it.
