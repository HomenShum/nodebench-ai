# Query Pattern 1: Quick Reference Guide

## 🎯 What is Query Pattern 1?

**Criteria-Based Search**: Find companies matching specific criteria
- Funding amount (min/max)
- Industry/sector
- Founding year (min/max)
- Founder experience requirement

---

## 📝 Example Queries

### Example 1: Healthcare Startups
```
"Find companies: $2M+ seed stage, healthcare/life science, 
founded after 2022, experienced founders"
```

### Example 2: FinTech Companies
```
"Search for fintech companies with $5M+ funding, 
founded 2021 or later"
```

### Example 3: Biotech with Experienced Founders
```
"Find biotech companies: $10M+ funding, founded 2020+, 
founders with startup experience"
```

```
matchesCriteria(company, criteria) {
  // ALL must pass (AND logic)
  
  if (criteria.minFunding) {
    if (company.totalFunding < criteria.minFunding) return false;
  }
  
  if (criteria.industry) {
    if (company.industry !== criteria.industry) return false;
  }
  
  if (criteria.minFoundingYear) {
    if (company.foundingYear < criteria.minFoundingYear) return false;
  }
  
  if (criteria.requireFounderExperience) {
    if (!company.hasFounderExperience) return false;
  }
  
  return true; // All criteria passed
}
```
