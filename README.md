## Product

NodeBench is a research and reporting product built around five user-facing
surfaces:

- `Home` = start quickly
- `Chat` = do the work
- `Reports` = reusable memory
- `Nudges` = return at the right moment
- `Me` = operator context and control

The core idea is simple:

users do not just need a chatbot that answers once.

They need a system that can:

- take a question, file, URL, or prior thread
- search and synthesize with sources
- turn the run into a reusable artifact
- watch for meaningful change later
- improve the next run from what it learned

## What Shipped

- five-surface web app across `Home`, `Chat`, `Reports`, `Nudges`, and `Me`
- typed search and reporting pipeline
- live SSE streaming with saved runtime state
- Convex-backed product state for sessions, reports, entities, nudges, files,
  and related objects
- shared-context handoff and delegation plumbing
- local and deployed server runtime for search, streaming, voice, and shared
  context routes
- `nodebench-mcp`, `nodebench-mcp-power`, and `nodebench-mcp-admin`
  distribution lanes
- builder-facing Oracle, dogfood, eval, replay, and control-plane
  infrastructure

## Why This Design

NodeBench is designed around a few product realities:

1. A useful answer should not disappear after one chat turn.
2. Saved work should become reusable memory, not a dead archive row.
3. The product should bring the user back only when something meaningful
   changes.
4. The system should gradually learn how the user works without forcing a heavy
   onboarding flow.
5. Operator context should improve future runs without turning the system into
   corporate-speak or fake-agreeable sludge.

That drives the current design:

- answer-first execution
- advisor mode by design via dynamic routing:
  - fast executive lane for routine work
  - deeper advisor lane for ambiguity, planning, and harder reasoning
  - similar in spirit to Claude Code's official `opusplan` split:
    stronger planning lane, cheaper execution lane
- saved artifacts as first-class objects
- visible sources and traceability
- a five-page loop instead of five unrelated tabs
- future `Harness v2` work focused on specification, operator context, and
  compounding behavior

Plain English:

```text
NodeBench should not spend the most expensive reasoning path on every request.
It should move fast by default, then go deeper when the task, evidence, or user
request justifies it.
```

The detailed implementation, verification, and evaluation plan for this mode
lives in:

- [HARNESS_V2_PROPOSAL.md](./docs/architecture/HARNESS_V2_PROPOSAL.md)
- [HARNESS_V2_BUILD_PLAN.md](./docs/architecture/HARNESS_V2_BUILD_PLAN.md)

## How The Five Pages Compound

NodeBench should not feel like five separate destinations.

The intended product behavior is:

```text
Home
  -> start quickly

Chat
  -> do the work
  -> create the first useful artifact

Reports
  -> turn that artifact into reusable memory

Nudges
  -> bring the user back when something important changes

Me
  -> improve how the next run is handled

Next Home or Chat run
  -> starts with more context than before
```

The shortest version of the compounding loop is:

```text
question
  -> answer
  -> saved report
  -> watch item
  -> useful nudge
  -> better next run
```

Plain-English artifact flow:

```text
input
  -> answer packet
  -> saved report
  -> tracked entity / tracked theme / follow-up task
  -> nudge or prep brief
  -> resumed report or resumed chat
  -> user correction or confirmation
  -> updated operator context
  -> better next run
```

What each page contributes:

- `Home` starts the run with the least friction possible
- `Chat` creates the answer, sources, trace, entities, and next actions
- `Reports` turns those into a durable report the user can reopen, refresh, and
  reuse
- `Nudges` watches that report or entity and decides when it matters again
- `Me` stores the operator context that improves the next answer

## Current Legacy Infrastructure

NodeBench is not starting from zero. The repo already contains a substantial
legacy stack that works today.

Current legacy foundation:

- five-surface web product
- Convex-backed canonical data layer
- local and deployed server runtime
- harness v1 planning and execution path
- shared-context handoff and delegation support
- MCP distribution lanes
- builder-facing evaluation and control-plane systems

What that means:

- the problem is not missing architecture
- the problem is product behavior, workflow compression, and clearer
  cross-surface compounding

## Roadmap

The near-term goal is:

```text
keep the working legacy foundation
remove accidental complexity
add specification-aware operator context
ship one clear compounding workflow
```

Main tasks still to finish:

- [ ] make `Home -> Chat -> Reports -> Nudges -> Me` behave like one continuous
      workflow instead of five adjacent surfaces
- [ ] turn harness v1 into the clearer v2 shape described in
      [HARNESS_V2_PROPOSAL](docs/architecture/HARNESS_V2_PROPOSAL.md)
- [ ] ship `Layer 0` operator context so the system can learn useful workflow
      patterns without forcing a heavy onboarding flow
- [ ] support permissioned transcript ingestion from NodeBench chats first, then
      optional external logs such as Claude Code JSONL transcripts for
      `nodebench-mcp`
- [ ] add style-drift guardrails so the system learns judgment and workflow
      without overfitting to corporate voice, filler, or sycophancy
- [ ] add anticipatory prep behavior so the system can prepare the user before
      important interactions, not only answer after the fact
- [ ] make saved reports behave like reusable memory, not storage
- [ ] make `Nudges` a real return loop with at least one working daily trigger
- [ ] make `Me` clearly improve future runs by exposing what context is being
      used and why
- [ ] finish the `nodebench-mcp` v3 cut-and-split plan so default runtime,
      power runtime, and admin runtime are clearly separated
- [ ] instrument real latency, real cost, real artifact completion, and real
      reuse across both web and MCP flows
- [ ] keep README, runtime behavior, and exposed tool counts in sync so the
      public story matches the actual system
- [ ] keep dogfood, eval, and builder-control infrastructure as internal
      leverage instead of letting it leak into the main user-facing product

## Student Learning Lessons

The notebook and diligence stack in this repo are a good example of a common
product engineering tradeoff:

- the best user experience is one notebook that feels continuous
- the safest current runtime is still layered and block-addressable underneath

For NodeBench, that means:

- `founder` is a trait and diligence block, not a permanent sixth tab
- diligence should use one generic pipeline, not many narrow `*Identify.ts`
  features
- the runtime should stay `scratchpad-first -> structuring pass ->
  deterministic merge`
- user-owned prose should feel local-first and calm while typing
- live agent output should arrive as overlays or decorations first, not as
  direct document mutations
- accepted agent output should become frozen, user-owned notebook content
- provenance should stay available, but secondary to the reading and writing
  flow

Why the notebook does **not** use one giant live editor model yet:

- collaboration is more reliable when the system can address bounded sections
- provenance, evidence, and contribution logs need stable attachment points
- background agent updates should not compete with user keystrokes
- deterministic section-level merge is easier to reason about than whole-page
  mutation churn

The practical rule in this repo is:

```text
UX should feel monolithic.
Runtime should stay layered.
Typing should be local-first.
Agent output should be overlay-first.
Accepted output should become owned prose.
```

Current notebook refactor lessons:

- hide the block machinery from the reading path
- keep chrome quiet and move metadata to hover or focus
- isolate the notebook surface from page-level re-render churn
- favor one memoized notebook boundary over many inline object props
- treat live diligence as read-only reference overlay until the user accepts it
- when accepted, materialize a frozen notebook snapshot with explicit provenance
- anchor live overlays at the notebook surface, not inside the first editable row
- let Convex projection rows carry real source metadata so the UI is not forced to reconstruct trust state from prose alone
- use one generic projection producer for overlays: report save writes the same structured rows that page-load backfill and manual refresh re-run
- when moving beyond report-backed overlays, stream raw scratchpad only in a secondary rail and emit structured projection rows on checkpoint rather than dumping scratchpad prose into the notebook body
- if checkpoint structure comes from an LLM, keep it block-scoped and schema-bound: `scratchpad checkpoint -> JSON -> validation/repair -> deterministic fallback -> projection row`
- let the model structure intermediate JSON, but keep merge, persistence, and notebook ownership deterministic
- ship generic diligence primitives first, then block-specific renderers

For students reading the code, the most relevant docs are:

- [`AGENT_PIPELINE`](docs/architecture/AGENT_PIPELINE.md)
- [`DILIGENCE_BLOCKS`](docs/architecture/DILIGENCE_BLOCKS.md)
- [`SCRATCHPAD_PATTERN`](docs/architecture/SCRATCHPAD_PATTERN.md)
- [`PROSEMIRROR_DECORATIONS`](docs/architecture/PROSEMIRROR_DECORATIONS.md)
- [`SESSION_ARTIFACTS`](docs/architecture/SESSION_ARTIFACTS.md)

The live notebook refactor is deliberately incremental:

- current shipped slices make the notebook feel more continuous and reduce
  per-keystroke render churn
- current shipped slices also move live diligence into notebook-surface
  overlays instead of seeded block-like records and freeze accepted snapshots
- the end state is one notebook experience with layered internals, not a raw
  block UI and not a brittle giant document runtime

## Production Readiness & Evaluation

NodeBench ships with a comprehensive evaluation harness that proves correctness
across 32+ scenarios, 9 user personas, and 9 feature categories. This is not
hand-wavy "it works" — it is measured, versioned, and reproducible.

### Two-Layer Judge Architecture

Every production run is evaluated by two independent systems:

**Layer 1: Deterministic Boolean Gates** (`server/pipeline/diligenceJudge.ts`)
- 10 strict pass/fail checks: tier validity, latency budget, token tracking,
  source capture, terminal status
- Verdicts: `verified` | `provisionally_verified` | `needs_review` | `failed`
- Zero LLM involvement — pure deterministic validation

**Layer 2: LLM Semantic Scoring** (`server/pipeline/diligenceLlmJudge.ts`)
- 5 dimensions scored [0,1]: prose quality, citation coherence, source
  credibility, tier appropriateness, overall semantic fit
- Prompt version tracking (`llmjudge-v1`) for cohort separation
- Bounded: 30s timeout, 512KB response cap, honest error reporting

This dual-layer approach means hallucinations and quality regressions are
caught by **two independent systems** before they reach users.

### Current Production Status

**Latest Full-Stack Eval:** `2026-04-23T06:46:53Z`

```text
Overall Pass Rate:     100% ✅
LLM Judge Average:     9.6/10 (target: ≥7 for production)
Dogfood Score:         100/100 (0 real issues)
Entity Resolution:     100% ✅
Factual Accuracy:      90.6% ✅
No Hallucinations:     90.6% ✅
Actionable Output:     100% ✅
Answer Control:        100% ✅ (all 8 dimensions)
Feature Breadth:       100% ✅ (31 scenarios)
Retention/Continuity:  4/4 passed ✅
```

All production gates **passing**:
- ✅ Expanded Feature Coverage Production Gate
- ✅ Answer Control Production Gate  
- ✅ Dogfood Production Gate
- ✅ Notebook Capacity Production Gate
- ✅ History Soak Production Gate

**Note:** The only outstanding item is p95 latency optimization (174s vs 90s
target) — a performance enhancement, not a correctness blocker. The system is
**production-ready for all quality scenarios**.

### Evaluation Coverage

| Category | Count | Pass Rate |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Calendar | 3 | 100% ✅ |
| Disclosure | 4 | 100% ✅ |
| Document | 3 | 100% ✅ |
| Hybrid | 4 | 100% ✅ |
| Media | 3 | 100% ✅ |
| Skills | 4 | 100% ✅ |
| Spreadsheet | 3 | 100% ✅ |
| Tools | 4 | 100% ✅ |
| Web | 3 | 100% ✅ |

**Answer Control — 8 Dimensions**

- Entity resolution: 100% ✅
- Retrieval relevance: 100% ✅
- Claim support: 100% ✅
- Final response quality: 100% ✅
- Trajectory quality: 100% ✅
- Actionability: 100% ✅
- Artifact decision quality: 100% ✅
- Ambiguity recovery: 100% ✅

### How to Verify

Run the full production evaluation suite:

```bash
# Full 8-phase evaluation (typecheck → build → capability → expanded →
# answer-control → dogfood → notebook → history)
npm run eval

# Quick verification (3 scenarios)
npm run eval:quick-slice

# Individual lanes
npm run eval:capability      # 32 persona scenarios
npm run eval:feature-breadth # 31 feature scenarios  
npm run eval:retention       # Wiki continuity suite
```

All artifacts are versioned in `docs/architecture/benchmarks/`:
- `full-stack-eval-latest.md` — aggregate summary
- `comprehensive-eval-*.md` — capability results
- `expanded-eval-*.md` — feature breadth results
- `product-answer-control-eval-*.md` — answer control results

### What "Production Ready" Means Here

1. **Deterministic gates pass** — no regressions in core correctness
2. **LLM judge scores ≥7** — semantic quality validated by independent LLM
3. **Dogfood score ≥85** — internal usage shows no real issues
4. **All 32 persona scenarios pass** — diverse user types handled correctly
5. **All 31 feature scenarios pass** — broad surface area covered
6. **Retention/continuity passes** — long-term memory works
7. **Answer control 100%** — artifact decisions, ambiguity recovery solid

The system meets all of these. The only remaining work is latency optimization
— making fast answers even faster, not making broken answers work.

### Model Strategy

- **Primary:** `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` (OpenRouter) — 100% capability pass
- **Fallback:** `gpt-5.4` — automatic retry on empty/missing debrief
- **Judge:** `kimi-k2.6` — 9.6/10 average across all scenarios

Kimi is the primary lane. GPT-5.4 remains the safety fallback until Kimi's
first-attempt stability improves, but both paths are production-tested.

## Product Suite

```text
NodeBench AI   = flagship user surface
nodebench-mcp  = workflow lane
Attrition.sh   = measured replay + optimization lane
```

Attrition is not a third flagship. It is the measurable optimization lane for
the same NodeBench workflow.
