## Best Practices

### 1. **Use Ticker Symbols**
Ticker symbols are easier than CIK numbers:
- ‚úÖ "Find filings for AAPL"
- ‚ùå "Find filings for CIK 0000320193"

### 2. **Specify Form Types**
Be specific about what you want:
- ‚úÖ "Get the latest 10-K for Tesla"
- ‚ùå "Get SEC filings for Tesla" (returns all types)

### 3. **Download Selectively**
Don't download everything - filings can be large:
- ‚úÖ "Download the latest 10-K"
- ‚ùå "Download all filings" (could be hundreds)

### 4. **Combine with Analysis**
Use document analysis tools after downloading:
- "Download Apple's 10-K and summarize the key risks"
- "Get Tesla's latest 10-Q and analyze revenue trends"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to look up ticker"
- Verify the ticker symbol is correct
- Try using the full company name instead
- Check if the company is publicly traded

### "Failed to fetch SEC filings"
- The CIK number might be incorrect
- SEC API might be temporarily unavailable
- Check your internet connection

### "Document truncated due to size"
- SEC filings can be very large
- The tool automatically truncates to 100KB
- Consider downloading specific sections instead
