## Overview
This document describes the media recording, upload, and rendering capabilities added to the Fast Agent Panel.

## Features Implemented

**Usage:**
Messages can now include:
```markdown
![Image description](https://example.com/image.jpg)

<video controls width="400">
  <source src="https://example.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://example.com/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
```

### 2. Audio & Video Recording
**New Component:**

3. Click "Start Recording" to begin
4. Click "Stop & Save" to finish and attach the recording

### 3. Drag & Drop Media Upload

When Linkup adds video/audio search results, they will automatically display in chat without any code changes needed.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "rehype-raw": "^7.0.0",
  "rehype-sanitize": "^6.0.0"
}
```

### Browser APIs Used
- **MediaDevices API:** For camera/microphone access
- **MediaRecorder API:** For recording audio/video
- **Drag and Drop API:** For file uploads
- **URL.createObjectURL:** For file previews

### Security
- `rehype-sanitize` sanitizes HTML to prevent XSS attacks
- Only media file types are accepted for uploads
- Recording permissions are requested explicitly
- Media streams are properly cleaned up on component unmount

## Usage Examples

### Recording Audio Message
```typescript
// User clicks microphone button
// -> Modal opens requesting microphone permission
// -> User clicks "Start Recording"
// -> Audio recording begins with visual feedback
// -> User clicks "Stop & Save"
// -> Audio file attached to message as "audio-1234567890.webm"
```

### Drag & Drop Multiple Images
```typescript
// User drags 3 image files from desktop
// -> Overlay shows "Drop media files here"
// -> Files dropped onto input area
// -> All 3 images attached with thumbnail previews
// -> User types message (optional)
// -> Send button enabled
```

### Linkup Search with Images (Current)
```typescript
// Agent uses: linkupSearch({ query: "show me puppies", includeImages: true })
// -> Returns markdown with images:
//    ![Labrador puppies](https://example.com/image1.jpg)
//    *Cute labrador puppies playing*
// -> ReactMarkdown renders actual images in chat
```

### Linkup Search with Videos (Future)
```typescript
// Agent uses: linkupSearch({ query: "how to cook pasta", includeVideos: true })
// -> When Linkup adds video support, will return:
//    <video controls width="400">
//      <source src="https://example.com/cooking.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
//    </video>
// -> ReactMarkdown with rehype-raw will render video player
```
