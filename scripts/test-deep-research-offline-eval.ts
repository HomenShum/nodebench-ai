// Ground truth query
const GROUND_TRUTH_QUERY = `Vijay Rao
https://www.linkedin.com/in/raovj/

Does it have to do with recent news for Manus acquisition? Vijay initiated the effort and scaled the GPU training clusters for serving and training AI Models. Manus trains their own Manus models for multimodal instruction following agent models and dogfood their own models for the browser automation tasks, which quite much aligns with the narrative where Tests Assured has deep QA Automation expertise, has been integrated with Meta, has proposed to make QA Automation platform to serve customers that need QA automation solution like testing out apps created by AI and generating report and optimization fixes. And other major companies like google gemini antigravity and browser base are all tackling this next trend. Meta can benefit dramatically from acquiring Manus and its foundational models, serve Manus the training capacities and grow super quickly, compete on global multimodal agentic AI models benchmarks, and let companies like tests assured and their development studio to spin off platforms that utilizes Manus by Meta and sell inference and earn revenue and profit and user training data for the next few years.

But, I can be very wrong, be brutally honest, deeply due diligence and critique and verify all information patches fully paralleled
How exactly did you come up with all this from my input? I want a full step by step guide for reproducing similar due diligence and verifications`;
