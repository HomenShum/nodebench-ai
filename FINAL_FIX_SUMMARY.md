# Fast Agent Panel: Final Answer Display Fix - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Issue Identified

**Problem**: The Fast Agent Panel was **only showing the Agent Progress timeline** and **not displaying the final answer** from the agent.

**User Observation**: When running a query like "Find companies: $2M+ seed stage, healthcare/life science, founded after 2022, experienced founders", users could see:
- ✅ Agent Progress (28 steps with tool execution details)
- ❌ Final Answer (missing/not visible)

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Conditional Answer Rendering
**File**: `src/components/FastAgentPanel/FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`
**Lines**: 953-1037 (before fix)

The answer section was only rendered if `cleanedText || visibleText` was truthy:
```typescript
{(cleanedText || visibleText) && (
  <div>
    {/* Answer content */}
  </div>
)}
```

**Problem**: While streaming, `message.text` might be empty or still being populated, so the answer section wouldn't render at all.

### Issue 2: Agent Progress Expanded by Default
**File**: `src/components/FastAgentPanel/FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`
**Lines**: 792-806 (before fix)

The CollapsibleAgentProgress was expanded by default when streaming:
```typescript
<CollapsibleAgentProgress
  ...
  defaultExpanded={message.status === 'streaming'}
  ...
/>
```

**Problem**: When streaming, the progress section took up all visible space, pushing the answer section below the fold.

### Issue 3: No Placeholder Feedback
**Problem**: Users saw nothing while the agent was working on the answer, creating confusion about whether the system was still processing.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Always Show Answer Section with Placeholder
**File**: `src/components/FastAgentPanel/FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`
**Lines**: 953-1046 (after fix)

```typescript
{!isUser || (cleanedText || visibleText) ? (
  <div>
    {/* Show placeholder while streaming and no text yet */}
    {!isUser && message.status === 'streaming' && !cleanedText && !visibleText ? (
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-gray-600">
        <Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
        <span className="text-sm">Generating answer...</span>
      </div>
    ) : (
      <ReactMarkdown>
        {/* Answer content */}
      </ReactMarkdown>
    )}
  </div>
) : null}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Answer section always visible for assistant messages
- ✅ Shows "Generating answer..." placeholder while streaming
- ✅ Displays final answer as soon as text is available
- ✅ Better user feedback during processing

### Fix 2: Collapse Agent Progress by Default
**File**: `src/components/FastAgentPanel/FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`
**Lines**: 792-806 (after fix)

```typescript
<CollapsibleAgentProgress
  ...
  defaultExpanded={false}
  ...
/>
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Final answer is visible first (better UX)
- ✅ Agent progress is collapsible for users who want details
- ✅ Cleaner, less cluttered interface
- ✅ Users can expand to see tool execution steps if needed
