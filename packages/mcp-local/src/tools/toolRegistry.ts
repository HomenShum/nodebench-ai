/**
 * Tool Registry — Central metadata catalog for all NodeBench MCP tools.
 *
 * Every tool gets: category, tags (for hybrid search), quickRef (what to do next),
 * relatedTools, and phase (which methodology phase it belongs to).
 *
 * The progressive disclosure system uses this to:
 * 1. Score tools by relevance (hybrid: keyword + tag + category matching)
 * 2. Append quickRefs to every tool response (so agents always know what to do next)
 * 3. Build tool chains (recommended sequences for common workflows)
