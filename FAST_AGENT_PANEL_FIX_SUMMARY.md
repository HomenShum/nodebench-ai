# Fast Agent Panel: Final Answer Display Fix

## 🎯 Problem

The Fast Agent Panel was **only showing the Agent Progress timeline** and **not displaying the final answer** from the agent. Users could see:
- ✅ Agent Progress (tool execution steps)
- ❌ Final Answer (missing/not visible)

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was in `FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`:

1. **Answer section was conditionally rendered** - Only showed if `cleanedText || visibleText` was truthy
2. **While streaming, text might be empty** - The agent was still generating the answer
3. **Agent Progress was expanded by default** - When streaming, the progress section took up all visible space
4. **No placeholder** - Users saw nothing while the agent was working on the answer

## ✅ Solution

### Change 1: Always Show Answer Section
**File**: `src/components/FastAgentPanel/FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`
**Lines**: 953-1046

**Before**:
```typescript
{(cleanedText || visibleText) && (
  <div>
    {/* Answer content */}
  </div>
)}
```

**After**:
```typescript
{!isUser || (cleanedText || visibleText) ? (
  <div>
    {/* Show placeholder while streaming and no text yet */}
    {!isUser && message.status === 'streaming' && !cleanedText && !visibleText ? (
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-gray-600">
        <Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
        <span className="text-sm">Generating answer...</span>
      </div>
    ) : (
      <ReactMarkdown>
        {/* Answer content */}
      </ReactMarkdown>
    )}
  </div>
) : null}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Answer section always visible for assistant messages
- ✅ Shows "Generating answer..." placeholder while streaming
- ✅ Displays final answer as soon as text is available
- ✅ Better user feedback during processing

### Change 2: Collapse Agent Progress by Default
**File**: `src/components/FastAgentPanel/FastAgentPanel.UIMessageBubble.tsx`
**Lines**: 792-806

**Before**:
```typescript
<CollapsibleAgentProgress
  ...
  defaultExpanded={message.status === 'streaming'}
  ...
/>
```

**After**:
```typescript
<CollapsibleAgentProgress
  ...
  defaultExpanded={false}
  ...
/>
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Final answer is visible first (better UX)
- ✅ Agent progress is collapsible for users who want details
- ✅ Cleaner, less cluttered interface
- ✅ Users can expand to see tool execution steps if needed

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Immediate Feedback**
- Users see "Generating answer..." while agent works
- No blank space or confusion

### 2. **Answer-First Design**
- Final answer is the primary focus
- Agent progress is secondary (collapsible)

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Simple view by default (just the answer)
- Detailed view available on demand (expand progress)

### 4. **Streaming Visibility**
- Answer appears as soon as text is available
- Placeholder shows during generation
- Smooth transition from placeholder to content

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Rendering Order
1. **Media Section** (videos, sources, documents)
2. **Agent Progress** (collapsed by default)
3. **Answer Section** (always visible)
4. **Action Buttons** (copy, regenerate, delete)

### Conditional Logic
```typescript
// Always show answer for assistant messages
!isUser || (cleanedText || visibleText)

// Show placeholder while streaming with no text
!isUser && message.status === 'streaming' && !cleanedText && !visibleText

// Show actual answer when text is available
cleanedText || visibleText
```
