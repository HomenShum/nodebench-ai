# üéØ Query Patterns Implementation - 100% Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented **100% support** for both multi-agent orchestration query patterns with full CRM field extraction, criteria-based search, and CSV export.

---

## Query Pattern 1: Criteria-Based Search ‚úÖ

### User Query
```
"Find companies: $2M+ seed, healthcare, founded 2022+, experienced founders"
```

### Implementation Status
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Tool**: `searchCompaniesByCriteria`
- **Expected Duration**: 30-60 seconds
- **Expected Results**: 5-10 companies

### How It Works
1. **Criteria Parsing**: Converts user criteria to structured filters
   - Funding: $2M+ (parsed to 2,000,000)
   - Industry: healthcare (keyword matching)
   - Founded: 2022+ (year extraction)
   - Founder Experience: verified from key personnel

2. **Search Execution**: Uses LinkUp API with deep search
   - Query: "healthcare companies founded after 2022 funded $2M or more"
   - Output: Structured company data

3. **Filtering**: Applies all criteria filters
   - Funding amount check
   - Industry detection
   - Founding year validation
   - Founder experience verification

4. **CRM Extraction**: Extracts 30 CRM fields for each result
   - Basic info, location, contact, people
   - Business, funding, competitive, regulatory
   - News, partnerships, data quality metrics

5. **Caching**: Stores results for instant follow-up queries
   - 7-day TTL
   - Access tracking
   - Version control

### Code Location
- **Tool Definition**: `convex/agents/specializedAgents.ts` (lines 912-1001)
- **Criteria Logic**: `convex/agents/criteriaSearch.ts`
- **CRM Extraction**: `convex/agents/crmExtraction.ts`

### Example Output
```
**Criteria Search Results** (8 companies found)

‚úÖ **Company A**
- Industry: healthcare
- Founded: 2023
- Funding: $5.2M
- Founders: John Doe, Jane Smith
- Location: San Francisco, CA
- Product: AI-powered diagnostics

‚úÖ **Company B**
- Industry: healthcare
- Founded: 2022
- Funding: $3.8M
- Founders: Bob Johnson
- Location: Boston, MA
- Product: Telemedicine platform

... (6 more companies)

‚úÖ All companies cached for instant follow-up questions!
